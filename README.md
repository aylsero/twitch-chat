# twitch-chat

# So the idea of this program is to be able to read twitch chat whilst in-game. This is mainly for people that only have 1 monitor as
it can be a pain that people have to keep tabbing out to engage with their chat. It's a nice useful tool that doesn't get in the way, and
lets the user engage with their chat.

If you'd like to make any changes to the code, feel free, but please credit me if you can :)
